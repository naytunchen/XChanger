Currency Exchange Buddy (Android Application)

An android mobile application that searches the nearest currency exchange booths and 
their currency exchange rate information to the users.


NOTE: 
This is a project that I'm working with my two other senior software engineer friends for Asia market.
I am in charge of developing an android version of this project and they are in charge of
web application and Web API.
Unfortunately, I am only allowed to showcase the APK but not the source code on Github.

YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE APK FILE FROM HERE OR AT THE FOLLOWING LINK:

This application is still under development therefore it may have some bugs in it. 
Also please note that we have only inserted some test data at some Geo locations only therefore 
you may not be able to find any booth if your current location is out of our test data booth range.

This app is developed targeting the android smartphones that have Lollipop for now hence some of the
features might not work properly on OSes that are below Lollipop.

Features implemented: 
- users can search, add, and update the exchange rate information of the booths
- users can view the booth information in detail
- google map integrated

Design, Techonlogies and Tools used:
- Android Studio
- Java
- Android SDK (GUI, GPS and Network for Geo location, etc)
- Google Map API v2
- JSON
- MVC Framework
- RESTful API (HTTP POST, GET, PUT) built on Cloud LAMP Server (Ubuntu Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
